To run: run the Scene class
I have included all of the .obj files, but if you are using your own, change the PATH variable to the package that contains your .obj files

Notes:
- Normals are calculated within GLObject's read function when it reads in a face
- Click on different parts of the screen to move around
- The plus button (keyboard) zooms in
- The minus button (keyboard) zooms out
